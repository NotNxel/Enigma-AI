            Enigma is a tiny AI lab built by two 10th‑grade students who love
            turning late‑night “vibe coded” ideas into real, usable tools for
            developers and creatives.

            <strong>Neel Nikhil Pappu</strong> is the co‑founder and CEO of Enigma,
            specializing in Artificial Intelligence, Fullstack Development and Data Science, 
            He is  focusing on product vision, experience, and how AI can feel less like
            a black box and more like a creative teammate.

            <strong>Reyansh Verma</strong> is the co‑founder and core developer at Enigma,

          <h2>What Enigma does</h2>
          <p>
            Enigma AI is an experimental tool that helps people “vibecode”:
            you describe what you want in plain language, and Enigma helps you
            move from fuzzy idea to structured code or a working prototype faster.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal is not to replace developers, but to give students, indie
            hackers, and small teams a smarter way to explore concepts, test
            flows, and ship more confidently.
